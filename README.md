Medical Diagnosis with CNN&amp; Transfer Learning
# Medical Diagnosis with CNN and Transfer Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a medical diagnosis system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transfer Learning techniques. The goal is to accurately classify medical images into different diagnostic categories.

## Features
- Image classification using pre-trained CNN models
- Transfer learning to improve classification performance
- Data augmentation techniques
- Evaluation metrics and performance analysis

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Pre-trained CNN models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet50)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Image processing libraries (e.g., OpenCV, PIL)

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Medical-Diagnosis-with-CNN-and-Transfer-Learning.git
   cd Medical-Diagnosis-with-CNN-and-Transfer-Learning
